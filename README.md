# rss-slack-integration
This module implements a super simple rss feed Slack integration that posts a
notification to a Slack group channel when new posts are added to the feed.

The module is a thin wrapper around the excellent
[rss-watcher module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-watcher). It essentially
uses the rss-watcher's `new article` event to fetch the article title and url,
and does a post request to a given Slack group's incoming web hook URL with a
message consisting of the article title and url.

## Installation

Simply install in project using `npm install --save rss-slack-integration`.


## Usage and Configuration

The module is very simple. It exposes a single function `start` which expects a
configuration object as its sole parameter.

Example usage:

```JavaScript
var rsi = require("rss-slack-integration");

rsi.start({
  feed: "https://example.com/rss",
  interval: 60,
  slackHook: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/yourservicehash",
  slackIcon: "https://example.com/icon.png",
  slackBotUser: "Bot Username"})
```
The `feed` property should be the URL of the rss feed you want to receive
updates about. Take care to provide the protocol part of the URL. The `interval`
property specifies the number of seconds between each poll of the rss feed.
Setting this to `60` means that the `rss-watcher` module will poll the
rss-feed for changes once a minute.

The `slackHook` property should be set to whatever URL was generated by Slack
when you created the
[incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks). The `slackIcon`
property should be set to the URL of the icon you want to use for the Slack
bot. The last property, `slackBotUser` should be set to whatever bot name you
want your Slack web hook messages to appear under, for example the name of the
rss feed's site.
